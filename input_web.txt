Introduction and Problem Statement 

The modernization of German partnership law through the Act on the Modernization of Partnership Law (MoPeG) has initiated a profound paradigm shift with far-reaching consequences, particularly in the intersection of civil and tax law. By abandoning the long-standing principle of the Gesamthand (a universal partnership with joint and several liability) as the default model for civil law partnerships and establishing legal capacity as the guiding principle for the Gesellschaft bürgerlichen Rechts (GbR – civil law partnership) in § 705(2) of the German Civil Code (BGB), the legislator created a new reality (Kilincsoy, 2023; Bachmann, 2022).. This civil law revolution necessitated a response from tax law, which had historically not differentiated based on legal capacity. The result is a legislative "repair" that has, paradoxically, created a new and more problematic dogmatic inconsistency, especially concerning the atypical silent partnership. 

This dissertation examines the resulting systematic gap. It argues that while the legislator successfully integrated non-legal entities in procedural tax law, it failed to do so in the substantive law of attribution. This failure endangers long-established tax principles, such as book-value neutrality, and places the tax administration's attempt at a remedy on constitutionally shaky ground. The aim is to demonstrate that the current legal situation is an untenable "tolerated illegality" that requires a definitive legislative correction.
